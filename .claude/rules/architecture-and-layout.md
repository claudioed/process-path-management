# Architecture details and package layout

Moved out of `CLAUDE.md`; still authoritative. The headline rules (inward-only
dependencies, no sibling calls) stay in `CLAUDE.md`.

Hexagonal / Ports & Adapters. Strict inward-only dependency rule —
**domain depends on nothing; application depends on domain; adapters
depend on application/domain** — enforced by `internal/architecture/architecture_test.go`
(arch-go fitness tests, `make arch-test`), not just convention:

- domain (`internal/domain/**`) may only depend on other domain packages.
- application (`internal/application/**`) may only depend on domain +
  application.
- inbound adapters never depend on outbound adapters, and vice versa.
- nothing under `internal/**` may import `cmd/**` — `cmd` is a leaf
  composition root, never a dependency of the layers it wires.

No framework, HTTP, Kafka, or SQL types in the domain layer. No JSON
struct tags in the domain packages.

Layout (annotations are the non-obvious part):

This service **never subscribes to another context's topic**. Its only
Kafka consumer (`internal/adapters/inbound/kafka`, run by
`cmd/pathmgmt-projector`) reads its OWN analytics topic
`warehouse.process-path-management.analytics` (ADR 0007). Every event is
enqueued onto both the integration and the analytics topic in the same
outbox transaction. `TestNoSiblingContextOutboundCalls` fails the build if
`internal/adapters/outbound/**` imports `net/http` — no REST or MCP client
to a sibling may ever be added.

Delivery modes (`DATABASE_URL` × `EVENT_PUBLISHER`) and the transactional
outbox (ADR 0003 — this repo is the fleet's reference implementation):
`.claude/rules/runtime-and-outbox.md`.
